# Jon Purdy

Hi! I’m Jon. My pronouns are they/them or he/him. I work on compilers for fun (here) and profit (at [Groq]). Most of my code these days is written in Haskell.

My main project is a statically typed concatenative systems programming language called [Kitten]; I’m currently working on a [reimplementation of the Kitten compiler][ktn]. I also do a lot of one-off compilers for all kinds of unusual language ideas, like [reactive imperative programming][Hap], and [using classical linear logic for concurrency][LLL], and <a href="https://github.com/evincarofautumn/evincarofautumn#readme" title="Not yet!">fun secret things I haven’t announced</a>.
